                                Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down and I'd like to
                                take a minute just sit right there I'll tell you how I become the prince of a town
                                called Bel Air...
                                <br><br>
                                In west Philadelphia born and raised on the playground is where I spent most of my days
                                chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool and all shootin' some b ball outside of the school
                                when a couple of guys who were up to no good started makin' trouble in my neighborhood I
                                got in one little fight and my mon scared and said you're movin' with your auntie and
                                uncle in Bel-Air I begged and pleaded with her day after day but she packed my suitcase
                                and sent me on my way she give me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket put my walkman
                                on and said I might as well kick it first class yo this is bad drinkin' orange juice out
                                of a champagne glass is this what the people of Bel-Air live like hmmm this might be all
                                right but wait I hear they're prissy? and all that is this the type of place that they
                                should send this cool cat I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're
                                prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
                                <br><br>
                                Well uh the plane landed and when I came out there was a dude looked like a cop standin'
                                there with my name out I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with
                                the quickness like lightening disapeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near the
                                licensce plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror if anything I could say that
                                this cab was rare but I thought man forget it yo homes to Bel-Air I pulled up to the
                                house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie yo homes smell ya later looked at my
                                kingdom I was finally there to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air!
