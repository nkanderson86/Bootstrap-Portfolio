# Bootstrap-Portfolio


First swing at making a website using bootstrap styling.  Struggled with a few things, but found the grid system to be pretty amazing and easy to use.  Still had to use a float-left on some content, which I wasn't stoked about.  

Would like to better understand how to set min-width effectively when scaling.  And if I should be worrying about rendering on a screen that is less than 300 pixels across.
